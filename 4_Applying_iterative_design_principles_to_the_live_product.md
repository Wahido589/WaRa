# Applying iterative design principles to the live product

The introduction went well and now we would like improve our product continously. 
Below you will find mostly excerpts of Tableau visualizations. You can find the corresponding workbook on my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/4_iterative_design_principles/Dashboard2?:language=de-DE&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) account.

First we look how our product is performing. We have designed KPI in chapter 1 which we use to measure our success. There are different layers which we could check:
 - KPI on business level (depending on business model, e.g. # of purchases, renewal of subscriptions, paying customer satisfaction)
 - KPI on customer journey level 
   - Acquisition (# of visitors/day)
   - Activation (# of account creations)
   - Retention (average customer lifespan)
   - Revenue (Customer Lifetime Value)
   - Referral (#new customers through referral)
- KPI on feature level
   - Acquisition (Who saw the features?)
   - Activation (Who used the feature?)
   - Retention (How often did a user return?)
   - Revenue (How much revenue through the feature?)
   - collected customer data provides further insights like: 
     - who used or used not the new feature
     - when and how a user use the new feature
 
 <p>In this chapter we will focus on >b>KPI on feature level<b>.</p>
