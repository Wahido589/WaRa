# Analytics for the win

Below you will find mostly excerpts of Tableau visualizations. You can find the corresponding workbook on my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/2_2_Analyze_for_the_win/Histogram?:language=de-DE&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) account.

We found out that our dataset describe rides in New York:

And via Googlemaps we quickly checked the how the distance is measured:

Through our data cleaning procedures we cut down the size of the data by 30% while improving the informative value of the dataset (left initial data/ right cleaned data):

<h3> There are a couple of areas that are worth taking a look at:</h3>

  - what about the distribution of Passenger Counts, as our taxi drones are only able to carry max. 2 people

  - at what time do people take rides

  - where are the most traffic congestions

We have also user survey data that could help us to answer from a segmented point of view
 - whether people would like to use a flying taxi or not (red=no, green=yes)

 - which segments are willing to pay a certain price for our service (gender: blue=men, green=women)

 - what are the concerns of people who would not use a flying taxi
