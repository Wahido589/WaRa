# Flying Taxis

<p> Hi there :wave: </p>
In this repo, I will apply the skills acquired in the Data Product Manager Nanodegree Program from Udacity. The goal is to create the MVP launch strategy for the first flying taxi service, Flyber :small_airplane:, in one of the most congested cities in America -- New York City :statue_of_liberty:. 

I have divided this Use Case into 4 chapters:

<b>1. [Starting the adventure](https://github.com/Wahido589/WaRa/blob/25f815c4174436a82882a92500d8468434fd0590/1_Starting_the_adventure.md) </b>:rocket:
We will start this journey by using Objectives and Key Results (OKR) and the selection of appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
Next we create an Instrumentation Plan, so that we are able to gather the right information to make good data-driven decisions. 
As a result we build our Data Pipeline with AWS. #aws #design_thinking #okr #data_strategy #business_dev

<b>2. Analytics for the win </b> :bar_chart: :
It is hard to make decisions without looking into data. Fortunately we have taxi ride data available. Furthermore, we have had interviews with users to understand how they think about our business idea. We already had a look into it while we discussed our OKR and the data strategy in the first chapter, because data is the basis for our decisions.
Thats why have a more detailed look at the information and take necessary steps to get the data ready for even deeper insights. This section is divided in an initial EDA part including data wrangling/cleaning [2.1](https://github.com/Wahido589/WaRa/blob/814e76e178c7fc36c167e169336fb925371e180e/2.1_Analytics_for_the_win.ipynb) and an analytics/viz [2.2](path) part.

<b>3. [Impact of Privacy Rights](https://github.com/Wahido589/WaRa/blob/875bf0b84f3d1bd256f66b8c4fc7dcfb8770656d/3_Impact_of_privacy_rights.md)</b> :orange_book: 
As a Product Manager we think interdisciplinary. That means we also have to deal with legal implications on our product. 
We will find out if privacy rights apply to our planned actions. If so, what exactly do we need to consider? Is there 
anything extra special we need to keep in mind? I will use this part of the use case as well to show areas of overlap
with my previous job as an IT consultant. Please be aware that this is no legal advice on how to deal with similar use cases. 
This is just for the purpose of showcasing my skillset. #iso2700x #itil #gdpr #dpo #itgc

<b>4. Applying iterative design principles to the live product</b> :arrows_counterclockwise:
