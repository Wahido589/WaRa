# Flying Taxis

<p> Hi there :wave: </p>
In this repo, I will apply the skills acquired in the Data Product Manager Nanodegree Program from Udacity. The goal is to create the MVP launch strategy for the first flying taxi service, Flyber :small_airplane:, in one of the most congested cities in America -- New York City :statue_of_liberty:. 

I have divided this Use Case into 4 chapters:

<b>1. [Starting the adventure](https://github.com/Wahido589/WaRa/blob/25f815c4174436a82882a92500d8468434fd0590/1_Starting_the_adventure.md) </b>:rocket:
We will start this journey by using Objectives and Key Results (OKR) and the selection of appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
Next we create an Instrumentation Plan, so that we are able to gather the right information to make good data-driven decisions. 
As a result we build our Data Pipeline with AWS. #aws #design_thinking #okr #data_strategy #business_dev

<b>2. Analytics for the win </b> :bar_chart:

<b>3. [Impact of Privacy Rights](https://github.com/Wahido589/WaRa/blob/875bf0b84f3d1bd256f66b8c4fc7dcfb8770656d/3_Impact_of_privacy_rights.md)</b> :orange_book: 
As a Product Manager we think interdisciplinary. That means we also have to deal with legal implications on our product. 
We will find out if privacy rights apply to our planned actions. If so, what exactly do we need to consider? Is there 
anything extra special we need to keep in mind? I will use this part of the use case as well to show areas of overlap
with my previous job as an IT consultant. Please be aware that this is no legal advice on how to deal with similar use cases. 
This is just for the purpose of showcasing my skillset. #iso2700x #itil #gdpr #dpo #itgc

<b>4. Applying iterative design principles to the live product</b> :arrows_counterclockwise:
