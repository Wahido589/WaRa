# Flying_Taxis

<p> Hi there :wave: </p>
In this repo, I will apply the skills acquired in the Data Product Manager Nanodegree Program from Udacity. The goal is to create the MVP launch strategy for the first flying taxi service, Flyber :small_airplane:, in one of the most congested cities in America -- New York City :statue_of_liberty:. 

You will see that I have divided this Use Case into 4 chapters:

<b>1. Starting the adventure </b>:rocket:

<b>2. Analytics for the win </b> :bar_chart:

<b>3. Impact of Privacy Rights</b> :european_union: 

<b>4. Applying Iterative Design Principles to the Live Product</b> :arrows_counterclockwise:
