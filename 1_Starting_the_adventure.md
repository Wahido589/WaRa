I am responsible for bringing the first flying taxi service to market by analyzing data and building a product proposal. 
My team and me have discussed and defined Objectives and Key Results (OKR) we want to hit. We want to tackle the most important one right now:

Objective: “Introduce Flyber Taxi as a trustworthy & unique experience to the market in Q2”

The Objective is focused on <b>User Acquisition</b>. At this point in the Product Development Cycle, we want to introduce our service into the market and gain trust of the customers and show them the benefit of Flying Taxis. In the Growth Phase we can focus more on User Engagement where we can improve the awareness and incorporate lessons learned through our first service flights. Later on in the Maturity Phase we can focus more on <b>User Retention & Profitability</b> to secure revenues and improve margins. Key Performance Indicators will help us to measure our actions.

KPIs:<p>1. Customer Acquisition Costs</p> <p>2. Number of Flights/ Week </p> <p>3. Number of Weekly active Users</p> <p>4. Net Promoter Score </p> <p>5. Average Score of Recommendation </p>
To be really able to measure the KPIs, we need to define thresholds that needs to be hit in order to determine success.
